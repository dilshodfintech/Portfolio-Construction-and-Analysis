## 1. Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python

### Fundamentals of risk and returns

* Basics of Returns
* Simple Rate of Return vs. Log Return
* Measures of Risk and Reward - Risk Adjusted Returns

### Beyond the Gaussian case: Extreme risk estimates

* Deviations from Normality
* Estimating VaR - Semi Deviation, VaR, CVaR

### Portfolio Optimization and The Efficient Frontier

* Efficient Frontier
* Asset Efficient Frontier
* Applying Quadprog to Draw the Efficient Frontier
* Locating the Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
* Plotting EW and GMV on the Efficient Frontier

### Diversification

* Limits of Diversification
* CPPI and Drawdown Constraints

### Monte Carlo Simulation

* Random Walks and Monte Carlo Simulation
* Interactive plots of Monte Carlo Simulation of CPPI and GBM

### Asset-Liability Management

* Present Values, Liabilities, and Funding Ratio
* CIR Model and Cash vs. ZC bonds
* Liability Driven Investing 
* Monte Carlo Simulation of coupon-bearing bonds using CIR
* Naive Risk Budgeting between the PSP & GHP
* Dynamic Risk Budgeting between PSP & LHP
